            <h4>Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases</h4>
            <p>
              This course provides an introduction to Knowledge Discovery in
              Databases (KDD) and Data Mining. KDD deals with data integration
              techniques and with the discovery, interpretation and
              visualization of patterns in large collections of data. Topics
              covered in this course include data warehousing and mediation
              techniques; data mining methods such as rule-based learning,
              decision trees, association rules and sequence mining; and data
              visualization. The work discussed originates in the fields of
              artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistical data
              analysis, data visualization, databases, and information
              retrieval. Several scientific and industrial applications of KDD
              will be studied. Recommended background: MA 2611, CS 2223, and CS
              3431, or CS 3733. This course will be offered in 2016-17, and in
              alternating years thereafter.
